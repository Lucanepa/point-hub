# KSCW LedBox watchdog.
#
# The vendor boot flow starts the app and the LED panel driver exactly once
# (rc.local -> bin/start). If either dies, the board goes dark until someone
# power-cycles it -- which, mid-match, means the scoreboard is simply gone.
#
# This keeps three things true, checking every 30s:
#   1. the scoreboard app is running
#   2. the LED panel driver (flushBuffer2) is running
#   3. the app is still PAINTING -- www/buffer.png is rewritten every frame
#      (~5 fps), so a stale file means the render thread died even though the
#      process is alive and still answering on port 8889. That failure is
#      invisible from the network: the bridge still reports "connected" while
#      the panel is frozen on the last frame.
#
# Restarting is always preferred over rebooting: a restart costs ~10s, a reboot
# costs ~60s and drops the wifi AP with it.
