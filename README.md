Mirrors an OpenVolley live match onto a **Tech4Sport LedBox** LED scoreboard.

Small Node service, **no production dependencies** (uses Node 22's built-in global
`WebSocket` for the relay client and `node:net` for the LedBox). It subscribes to the
LAN relay, maps the live match state onto the LedBox `volleyball_matchscore` layout,
and pushes it over TCP with the documented gzip/JSON protocol.

## Fields shown
points · team short names (in team colour) · sets won · timeouts (**T**) · substitutions (**S**) · serve indicator

## Configure
Copy `.env.example` → `.env`. Key vars: `RELAY_URL`, `MATCH_ID`, `LEDBOX_HOST`.

## Test / run
```bash
# unit test: mapper → client → mock LedBox (no deps, no hardware) — the on-Pi smoke test
npm run test:mapper

# integration test: mock relay → bridge → mock LedBox (needs devDeps)
npm install && npm run test:relay

# run for real against the built-in mock (no hardware):
MOCK=1 MATCH_ID=123 RELAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8080 node src/bridge.js

# run against a real LedBox:
MATCH_ID=123 LEDBOX_HOST=172.24.1.1 node src/bridge.js
```

## Appliance — web control UI (manual + link)
Instead of the headless bridge, run the **appliance**: a phone-friendly control page
served by the Pi (`CONTROL_PORT`, default 8890) with two modes — **Manual** (drive the
board by hand: names, ±points, sets, timeouts, subs, serve, swap) and **Link** (list LAN
matches from the relay and mirror one live). Cloud/Supabase source is a stub.
```bash
npm run appliance                 # open http://<pi-ip>:8890  (or http://openvolley:8890 over Tailscale)
MOCK=1 npm run appliance          # in-process mock LedBox, no hardware
npm run test:appliance            # API → source → mapper → mock LedBox integration test
```
Architecture and the remaining phases (cloud source, auth, persistence) are in
[`DESIGN-appliance.md`](./DESIGN-appliance.md).

## Deploy on the Pi (systemd)
```bash
# on the Pi (reachable as `ssh openvolley`):
cd ~/ledbox-bridge
cp .env.example .env && nano .env        # set MATCH_ID, LEDBOX_HOST
sudo cp systemd/ledbox-bridge.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now ledbox-bridge
journalctl -u ledbox-bridge -f
```

## Status / open items
- **Validated:** mapper + protocol + TCP client + relay subscriber, on the Pi 5 against
  mocks (`npm test`).
- **Wired (app side):** the Scoreboard now also pushes its computed live-state over the
  LAN relay as a `live-state-update` message (`Scoreboard.jsx`); `server.js` merges it
  into the match store and fans it out to subscribers, and the bridge consumes it.
  Verified with mocks — still needs a live end-to-end run with a real scoreboard + relay.
- **Pending (hardware):** confirm the real LedBox's `volleyball_matchscore` section
  names — especially `sub1`/`sub2` and the team-name fields — and upload a custom
  layout via TCP :12345 if they differ.
